# projects

The files in this repository are simple, learning projects.

# Motivations
Built and uploaded as small projects, completed as I continue to learn skills and languages.

# Build Status
Due to the projects being small and insignificant, once they are added, they are unlikely to be edited. However, as I learn, more projects in more languages will be added

# Current languages
- Python
- C++

# Projects
## password
This is a simple program that asks for the desired length of a password, and prints a string of random characters of the given length. It will ask if you want another password before closing
## fizzbang
This program gives the result of a game of fizzbang for the first 1000 moves. It will prompt you to enter the integers for which multiples are called fizz or bang.
