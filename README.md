# Projects

The files in this repository are simple, learning projects.

# Motivations
Built and uploaded as small projects, completed as I continue to learn skills and languages.

# Build Status
Due to the projects being small and insignificant, once they are added, they are unlikely to be edited. However, as I learn, more projects in more languages will be added

# Current languages
- Python
- C++

# Projects
## Password
This is a simple program that asks for the desired length of a password, and prints a string of random characters of the given length. It will ask if you want another password before closing
## FizzBuzz
This program gives the result of a game of fizzbuzz for the first 1000 moves. It will prompt you to enter the integers for which multiples are called fizz or buzz.
## Maze solver
This program parses the maze, and finds dead ends. Once dead ends are found, they are blacked out. This continues until there are no more deadends. The resulting output will be the route (if a maze has loops or more than one route, then all possible paths will be shown). 
Further possible additions include:
- using djikstra's algorithm to find the shortest route
- C++ maze solver asking for inputs and giving the ouput in the same format as the python script.
## Pin lock
This program asks the user for a code, then depending on the validity of the code prints a message. It can be easily adjusted to open a real lock, however, i left this to the individual user so as to not clutter the code unnecessarily.

This will be edited in the future to add a GUI so as to create a usable product (on a device such as a raspberry pi), and may receive an app to edit users only on the back end (e.g. details cant be altered at the point of entering a pin, and all users are stored on an external databse).
